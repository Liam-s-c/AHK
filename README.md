# AutoHotKey
ALL of My scripts - (not just for the 2nd keyboard.)

; most of the code is highly edited and inspired from: https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard
; most not if all the videos that I link here is from Taran VH: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd0ZD4iCXRXf18p3cA7EQfg
#### So, to summarize, if you want to make your own macro keyboard, these are all the methods that I know of ;<-- videos are from TaranVH =>
- Luamacros (unstable/buggy, no longer recommended) https://youtu.be/Arn8ExQ2Gjg
- Interception https://youtu.be/y3e_ri-vOIo and https://youtu.be/Hn18vv--sFY
- iCue (K55) https://youtu.be/cQ2atofn3lE
- Razer Synapse (Cyonosa Chroma) https://youtu.be/GttedCcyxa4
- QMK (Hasu USB converter) https://youtu.be/GZEoss4XIgc


#### Other potential methods ;<-- I need to test these, or do more reasearch =>
- MacroMyKBD https://github.com/lal12/macroMyKBD
- 2key, which uses a Raspberry Pi. https://github.com/Gum-Joe/2Keys/blob/v0.3.5/docs/SETUP.md
- https://mediachance.com/multikeyboard/ More info: https://twitter.com/iamnottani/status/1271530470052974595 and https://twitter.com/weirdoyt/status/1257282783044493312
- Here is an alternative to the Hasu USB converter: https://github.com/oschwartz10612/Scanner-Pro-MK3


If all of this just seems like a huge PITA, just buy a Stream Deck instead: https://youtu.be/vhPLhfP1b_s

NOTE: You do not need a 2nd keyboard to use AutoHotKey. Most poeple don't. By the time you need to add a 2nd keyboard, you should already be quite familiar with how AutoHotKey works. You can probably use your function keys for AHK macros, and if your main keyboard has dedicated macro keys, you can also use those.

Basically, don't just add a 2nd keyboard because you think it's cool! Make sure you actually need it, because you've run out of space on your main keyboard.
